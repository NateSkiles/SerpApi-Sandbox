# SerpApi Exercises

## Setup

`npm install`

## Exercise 1

Make a script to fetch the date of birth of any famous person using our API. For this task, work on two versions. One using direct GET requests and parsing the JSON. One using one of our official libraries. (https://github.com/serpapi) You can use any of the languages we have an official library in. (optional if not technical) Make a third version from scratch without using SerpApi at all: try to scrape Google directly.
